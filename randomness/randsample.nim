   ## samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned
   ## into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).

   ## population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible
   ## selection in the sample.

   ## Sampling without replacement entails tracking potential
   ## selections (the pool) in a list.
